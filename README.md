- This page is currently under construction. 
- The university learning platform LEA is still the official source of information.
- Testing with classroom.github.com is being done to see if it helps manage the projects for this course.

##### Nvidia Links
Everyone hates getting a bunch of newsletter mail, but I hightly recommend signing up to some of the nvidia newsletters.
http://www.nvidia.com/object/newsletter.html, even if you don't have an Nvidia GPU they're often sharing very interesting articles and projects for Machine Learning, and Robotics.

If you have an Nvidia GPU and are using 14.04, check out their DIGITS project.
